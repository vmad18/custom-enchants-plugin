# Custom Enchants Plugin 
My take on Minecraft Custom Enchants, still a work in progress, kind of. 

# About 
This is a spigot (1.16.1) lore based custom enchants plugin (i.e. server side) where the lore is stripped and the effects of the custom enchants are applied. 

Additionally, I added other custom enchants asides from merely adding potion effects for which you can see in the code. 

Creating new custom enchants is easy with the EnchantCreator class. 

I made this code a while back and decided to add it here, so there are probably better ways of doing things...but it works for the most part.  

# To-Do 
- Make enchants apply via book. 
- Clean-up/optimize code 
- Other stuff that I can't think of right now.
